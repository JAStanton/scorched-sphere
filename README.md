### Instructions on how to build:

* Install Node (http://nodejs.org/download/ which now comes with NPM which is also a dependency)
* Install Closure Compiler (https://github.com/gmarty/grunt-closure-compiler) using `$CLOSURE_PATH` as your environment setting that points to closure.
* Get dependencies: `npm install`
* Compile with grunt: `grunt`
